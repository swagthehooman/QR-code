## My process

So the required resources where already provided. Images, html file and design outcome. I first began with a whiteboard template ideas about how to position all components, approximate size, paddings, etc. Next I started with the html file which was easy. I linked all fonts and stylesheets along the way. Next was CSS. With the basic idea in my mind, simple template was achieved easily. Then just to fine tune my component, I used pesticide for google and chrome developer tools to get exact ideas about what to change. And tada, my QR code component was ready. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom property

### What I learned

The most important thing I learned was how to center the main div box without position properties. position properties may have had an adverse effect in case of responsiveness in mobiles vs desktop.
